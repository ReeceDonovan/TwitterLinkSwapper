# TwitterLinkSwapper

## Overview

TwitterLinkSwapper is a userscript designed to enhance your Twitter experience. It automatically swaps standard Twitter links with `fxtwitter` links when you copy a post link via the share button. This can be especially useful for users who prefer the alternative Twitter embed handling provided by `fxtwitter`.

## Features

- **Automatic Link Conversion:** Converts Twitter links to `fxtwitter` links on share.
- **Broad Compatibility:** Works on various Twitter domains including the twitter domain, mobile, X domain, and TweetDeck.
